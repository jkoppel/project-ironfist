A bare-bones viewer for the Heroes II GUI specification files. Run h2guiview.exe from the same directory you run Heroes II. You will be greeted with two windows: a blank Heroes II game window, and a console window. Enter the name of a .bin file into the console window and press Enter. You will then see a minimally-interactive, uninitialized version of the corresponding GUI in the Heroes II window, while the console will dump information about all the widgets in that GUI file.

Like Project Iornfist itself, h2guiview interacts with a disassembly of the original game. To compile the program anew, follow similar instructions to those for compiling the game on the Project Ironfist wiki.
