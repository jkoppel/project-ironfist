GrayFace's tools for handling Heroes II AGG (aggregate) files.

To unpack an AGG file: Drag and drop the .AGG file onto H2AggUnpack.exe

To pack a folder into an AGG file: Ensure there is a folder whose name is the same as the .AGG file to be replaced, minus the extension. Drag the .AGG file to be replaced onto H2AggPack.exe . For example, if you wish to pack "ironfist.agg" and there is a folder called "ironfist" in the same directory, then drag "ironfist.agg" onto H2AggPack.exe . Do not drag the "ironfist" folder onto H2AggPack.exe .

You can also double-click the programs for instructions.

A demonstration of these programs can be seen in "Modding with an Iron Fist: Episode 3: Adding New Creatures," http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLEjN6YkvEQ
